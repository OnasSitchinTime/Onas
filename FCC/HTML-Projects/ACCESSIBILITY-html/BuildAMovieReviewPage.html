        <p>"Mamma Mia!" is a feel-good movie musical based on the songs of ABBA, telling the story of a young woman's
            quest to discover her father's identity before her wedding. The film centers on Sophie, who secretly invites
            three men from her mother Donna's past to her wedding, each potentially her father. The film is set on a
            beautiful Greek island and features a celebration of mothers and daughters, old friends, and new family
            found.</p>
