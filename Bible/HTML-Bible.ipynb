    "        1. / or \\ - Path Seperator. Indicates a break in the text between folder or file names.\n",
    "        2. ./ - Current Directory. Indicates the current directory or folder.\n",
    "        3. ../ - Parent Directory. Indicates the parent directory or folder.\n",
    "    Absolute Path: a complete link to a resource. It starts from the root directory, includes every other directory, and finally the filename and extension.\n",

    "        Example: ./img/fcc_secondary_small.svg\n",
    "    Relative paths are useful for linking to resources within the same website, as they allow you to move files around without breaking links.\n",
    "Link States\n",
    "    :Link - This is the default state. This state represents a link which the user has not visited, clicked, or interacted with yet. You can think of this state as providing the base styles for all links on your page. The other states build on top of it.\n",
    "    :Visited - This applies when a user has already visited the page being linked to. By default, this turns the link purple - but you can leverage CSS to provide a different visual indication to the user.\n",
    "    :Hover - applies when a user is hovering their cursor over a link. This state is helpful for providing extra attention to a link, to ensure a user actually intends to click it.\n",

    "WAI-ARIA, Roles and Attributes\n",
    "    WAI-ARIA: Stands for Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications. It is a set of attributes that can be added to HTML elements to improve accessibility. It provides additional semantic information to assistive technologies about the purpose and structure of the content.\n",
    "    ARIA Roles: A set of predefined roles that can be added to HTML elements to define their purpose. This helps people using assistive technologies understand the content of the website. \n",
    "        Examples Include: \"tab\", \"menu\", \"alert\"\n",
    "        There are 6 main categories of ARIA roles:\n",
    "            Document Structure Roles: These roles define the overall structure of the web page. With these roles, assistive technologies can understand the relationships between different sections and help users navigate the content.\n",
    "            Widget Roles: These roles define the purpose and functionality of interactive elements, like scrollbars.\n",
    "            Landmark Roles: These roles classify and label the primary sections of a web page. Screen readers use them to provide convenient navigation to important sections of a page.\n",
    "            Live Region Roles: These roles define elements with content that will change dynamically. This way, screen readers and other assistive technologies can announce changes to users with visual disabilities.\n",
    "            Window Roles: These roles define sub-windows, like pop up modal dialogues.\n",
    "                Examples Include: \"alertdialog\", \"dialog\"\n",
    "            Abstract Roles: These roles help organize the document. They're only meant to be used internally by the browser, not by developers, so you should know that they exist but you shouldn't use them on your websites or web applications.\n",
    "    Aria-label/aria-lebelledby attributes: These attributes are used to give an element a programmatic (or accessible) name, which helps people using assistive technology (such as screen readers) understand the purpose of the element. They are often used when the visual label for an element is an image or symbol rather than text.\n",
    "        aria-label - allows you to define the name directly in the attribute\n",
    "        aria-labelledby - allows you to reference existing text on the page. \n",
    "        Example Codes:   <button aria-label=\"Search\">\n",
    "                            <i class=\"fas fa-search\"></i>\n",
    "                        </button>\n",

    "                        <button type=\"button\" id=\"search-btn\">Search</button>\n",
    "    aria-hidden attribute: used to hide an element from assistive technologies such as screen readers. For example, this can be used to hide decorative images that do not provide any meaningful content.\n",
    "        Example Code:   <button>\n",
    "                            <i class=\"fa-solid fa-gear\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i>\n",
    "                            <span class=\"label\">Settings</span>\n",
    "                        </button>\n",
    "    aria-expanded attribute: Used to convey the state of a toggle (or disclosure) feature to screen reader users.\n",
    "        Example Code:   <button aria-expanded=\"true\">Menu</button>\n",
    "    aria-live attribute: Used to indicate that an element's content is important enough to require that any changes to the content should be announced immediately to screen reader users. This can include status messages like updating the number of results returned from a search, or an error message displayed after an unsuccessful form submission.\n",
    "        Example Codes:  <div aria-live=\"assertive\">\n",
    "                            <p>Your session will expire in 30 seconds.</p>\n",

    "                        </div>\n",
    "    Common ARIA States: These attributes can be used to indicate the state of an element and help people using assistive technologies understand the content of the website.\n",
    "        Examples Include: aria-haspopup, aria-checked, aria-diabled, and aria-selected.\n",
    "        aria-haspopup attribute: This state is used to indicate that an interactive element will trigger a pop-up element when activated. You can only use this attribute when the pop-up has one of the following roles: menue, listbox, tree, grid, or dialog. The value of this attribute must be one of the above mentioned roles, or true (which is the same as the menu role).\n",

    "        aria-checked attribute: This attribute is used to indicate whether an element is in the checked state. It is most commonly used when creating custom checkboxes, radio buttons, switches, and listboxes.\n",
    "            Example Code: <div role=\"checkbox\" aria-checked=\"true\" tabindex=\"0\">Checkbox</div>\n",
    "        aria-disabled attribute: This state is used to indicate that an element is disabled only to people using assistive technologies, such as screen readers.\n",
    "            Example Code: <div role=\"button\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-disabled=\"true\">Edit</div>\n",
    "        aria-selected attribute: This state is used to indicate that an element is selected. You can use this state on custom controls like a tabbed interface, a listbox, or a grid.\n",
    "            Example Code:   <div role=\"tablist\">\n",
    "                                <button role=\"tab\" aria-selected=\"true\">Tab 1</button>\n",
