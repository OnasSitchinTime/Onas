            Syntax Linking to a external JavaScript file: <script src="script.js"></script>

    Boilerplate and Encoding
        HTML Boilerplate: The basic structure of an and essential elements every HTML document needs.

            DOCTYPE - Tells the browser which version of HTML the document is written in.
            Html Elements - represents the top level element or the root of an HTML document. Use a lang attribute to specify which language the document is written in.
            Head Elements - contains important meta data which is behind-the-scenes information needed for browsers and search engines.
            Meta Elements - represent your site's metadata. These element have details about things like character encoding, and how websites like Twitter should preview your page's link and more. Use the charset attribute inside a meta element to set the character encoding.
            Title Element - used to set the text that appears in the browser tab or window.
            UTF-8 Character Encoding (or UCS Transformation Format 8) - is a standardized character encoding widely used on the web. Character encoding is the method computers use to store characters as data. 
                Example Code:
                <!DOCTYPE html>
                <html lang="en">

                        <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
                    </head>
                    <body>
                        <!--Headings, paragraphs, images, etc. go inside here-->

                        id: provides a unique identifier for the input field, which can be used for styling or scripting.

                Optimizing Media: There are three tools to consider when using media, such as images, on your web pages: the size, the format, and the compression. A compression algorithm is used to reduce the size for files or data.

                    Image Formats: Common image formats include JPEG, PNG, GIF, WEBP, AVIF and SVG.
                        JPEG: Best for photographs and images with many colors.
                        PNG: Best for images with transparency or simple graphics.

                        WEBP: Best for high-quality images with smaller file sizes.
                        AVIF: Best for high-quality images with even smaller file sizes than WEBP.
                        SVG: Best for vector graphics and logos.

                    Image Licenses: An image under the public domain has no copyright attached to it and is free to be used without any restrictions. Images licensed specifically under the Creative Commons 0 license are considered public domain. Some images might be released under a permissive license, like a Creative Commons license, or the BSD license that freeCodeCamp uses.

                    SVGs: Scalable Vector Graphics track data based on paths and equations to plot points, lines, and curves. What this really means is that a vector graphic, like an SVG, can be scaled to any size without impacting the quality.

                _unfencedTop: opens the link in a new tab or window, but does not allow the new page to access the opener (the original page).

    Absolute vs. Relative Paths
    Path Definition: A path is a string that specifies the location of a file or directory in a file system. In web development, paths let developers link to resources like images, stylesheets, scripts, and other web pages.

    Path Syntax: 3 key syntaxes;
        1. / or \ - Path Seperator. Indicates a break in the text between folder or file names.
        2. ./ - Current Directory. Indicates the current directory or folder.
        3. ../ - Parent Directory. Indicates the parent directory or folder.

    Absolute Path: a complete link to a resource. It starts from the root directory, includes every other directory, and finally the filename and extension.
        Root Directory: The top-level directory in a file system, which contains all other directories and files.
        Protocol: The method used to access the resource, such as HTTP, HTTPS, or file.
        Domain Name: The unique name that identifies a website on the internet.
       Example: https://design-style-guide.freecodecamp.org/img/fcc_secondary_small.svg"

    Relative Path: specifies the location of a file relative to the directory of the current file. It does not include the protocol or the domain name, making it shorter and more flexible for internal links within the same website. 
        Example: ./img/fcc_secondary_small.svg

    Relative paths are useful for linking to resources within the same website, as they allow you to move files around without breaking links.

    Link States
        :Link - This is the default state. This state represents a link which the user has not visited, clicked, or interacted with yet. You can think of this state as providing the base styles for all links on your page. The other states build on top of it.

        :Visited - This applies when a user has already visited the page being linked to. By default, this turns the link purple - but you can leverage CSS to provide a different visual indication to the user.

        :Hover - applies when a user is hovering their cursor over a link. This state is helpful for providing extra attention to a link, to ensure a user actually intends to click it.

        :focus - applies when a user has clicked on a link, or navigated to it using the keyboard. This state is useful for accessibility, as it indicates which link is currently selected.

        :active - applies when a user is actively clicking on a link. This state is useful for providing feedback to the user that their click has been registered.

            It is recommended to order the link states in the following way:
            :link, :visited, :hover, :focus, :active

SEMANTIC HTML - REVIEW GUIDE
    Importance of Semantic HTML
        Structural hierarchy for heading elements: It is important to use the correct heading element to maintain the structural hierarchy of the content.
            The <h1></h1> element is the higest level of heading.
            The <h6></h6> element is the lowest level of heading.

        Presentational HTML elements: Elements that define the apperance of content. NOTE - when using HTML 5 these elements are deprecated as you should do all styling with CSS.
            Examples Include: <center></center>, <big></big>, or <font></font> Elements.

        Semantic HTML elements: are elements that hold both meaning and structure. 
            Examples Include: <header></header>, <nav></nav>, <figure></figure> Elements.

HTML ACCESSIBILITY - REVIEW GUIDE
    Assistive Technology for Accissibility
        Screen Readers: Software programs that read the content of a computer screen out loud. They are used by people who are blind or visually impaired to access the web.

        Large Text or Braille Keyboards: Used by people with visual impairments to access the web.
        Screen Magnifiers: Software programs that enlarge the content of a computer screen. They are used by people with low vision to access the web.

        Alternative Pointing Devices: Used by people with mobility impairments to access the web. 
            Examples Include: Joysticks, Trackballs, and Touchpads.

        Voice Recognition: Used by people with mobility impairments to access the web. It allows users to control a computer using their voice.

    Accessibility Auditing Tools
        The following are some common tools and platforms used to audit the accessibility of a website: Google Lighthouse, Wave, IBM Equal Accessibility Checker, and axe DevTools.

    Accessibility Best Practices
        Proper Heading Level Structure: You should use proper heading levels to create a logical structure for your content. This helps people using assistive technologies understand the content of your website.

        Accessibility and Tables: The following helps people with Assistive Technology to understand the structure of the table.
            Use the <th> element to define header cells;
            Use the <td> element to define data cells;
            <caption> element allows you to caption/title the table making the purpose and content within the table easy to understand - belongs directly after opening tag of table element.

        Importance for Inputs to have an Associated Label: associated form inputs with a label element ensures people know the purpose of the input.

        Importance of Good Alt Text: providing clear text alternatives for images ensures EVERYONE can acess and understand the content on your web page.

        Importance of Good Link Text: descriptive link text helps people understand the purpose of the link.

        Best Practices for Making Audio and Video Content Accessible: this feels self explanatory - but some people cant hear, so using cations and transcripts, other people cant see so provide audio descriptions.

        Tabindex Attributex: used to make elements focusable and define the relative order in which they should be navigated by using the keyboard. 
            Never use the tabindex attribute with a value greater than 0 - instead use a value of 0 or -1. 
            Basic Syntax: <p tabindex="-1">Sorry, there was an error with your submission.</p>

        Accesskey Attribute: is used to define a keyboard shortcut for an element. This can help users with mobility impairments navigate the website more easily. 
            Example Code:   <button accesskey="s">Save</button>
                            <button accesskey="c">Cancel</button>
                            <a href="index.html" accesskey="h">Home</a>

    WAI-ARIA, Roles and Attributes
    WAI-ARIA: Stands for Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications. It is a set of attributes that can be added to HTML elements to improve accessibility. It provides additional semantic information to assistive technologies about the purpose and structure of the content.

    ARIA Roles: A set of predefined roles that can be added to HTML elements to define their purpose. This helps people using assistive technologies understand the content of the website.
        Examples Include: "tab", "menu", "alert"

        There are 6 main categories of ARIA roles:
            Document Structure Roles: These roles define the overall structure of the web page. With these roles, assistive technologies can understand the relationships between different sections and help users navigate the content.

            Widget Roles: These roles define the purpose and functionality of interactive elements, like scrollbars.

            Landmark Roles: These roles classify and label the primary sections of a web page. Screen readers use them to provide convenient navigation to important sections of a page.

            Live Region Roles: These roles define elements with content that will change dynamically. This way, screen readers and other assistive technologies can announce changes to users with visual disabilities.

            Window Roles: These roles define sub-windows, like pop up modal dialogues.
                Examples Include: "alertdialog", "dialog"

            Abstract Roles: These roles help organize the document. They're only meant to be used internally by the browser, not by developers, so you should know that they exist but you shouldn't use them on your websites or web applications.

    Aria-label/aria-lebelledby attributes: These attributes are used to give an element a programmatic (or accessible) name, which helps people using assistive technology (such as screen readers) understand the purpose of the element. They are often used when the visual label for an element is an image or symbol rather than text.
        aria-label - allows you to define the name directly in the attribute
        aria-labelledby - allows you to reference existing text on the page. 
        Example Codes:   <button aria-label="Search">
                            <i class="fas fa-search"></i>
                        </button>
                        
                        <input type="text" aria-labelledby="search-btn">
                        <button type="button" id="search-btn">Search</button>

    aria-hidden attribute: used to hide an element from assistive technologies such as screen readers. For example, this can be used to hide decorative images that do not provide any meaningful content.
        Example Code:   <button>
                            <i class="fa-solid fa-gear" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                            <span class="label">Settings</span>
                        </button>

    aria-expanded attribute: Used to convey the state of a toggle (or disclosure) feature to screen reader users.
        Example Code:   <button aria-expanded="true">Menu</button>

    aria-live attribute: Used to indicate that an element's content is important enough to require that any changes to the content should be announced immediately to screen reader users. This can include status messages like updating the number of results returned from a search, or an error message displayed after an unsuccessful form submission.
        Example Codes:  <div aria-live="assertive">
                            <p>Your session will expire in 30 seconds.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div aria-live="polite">
                            <p>File successfully uploaded</p>
                        </div>

    Common ARIA States: These attributes can be used to indicate the state of an element and help people using assistive technologies understand the content of the website.
        Examples Include: aria-haspopup, aria-checked, aria-diabled, and aria-selected.
        aria-haspopup attribute: This state is used to indicate that an interactive element will trigger a pop-up element when activated. You can only use this attribute when the pop-up has one of the following roles: menue, listbox, tree, grid, or dialog. The value of this attribute must be one of the above mentioned roles, or true (which is the same as the menu role).
            Example Code:   <button id="menubutton" aria-haspopup="menu" aria-controls="filemenu" aria-expanded="false">File</button>
                            <ul id="filemenu" role="menu" aria-labelledby="menubutton" hidden>
                                <li role="menuitem" tabindex="-1">Open</li>
                                <li role="menuitem" tabindex="-1">New</li>
                                <li role="menuitem" tabindex="-1">Save</li>
                                <li role="menuitem" tabindex="-1">Delete</li>
                            </ul>

        aria-checked attribute: This attribute is used to indicate whether an element is in the checked state. It is most commonly used when creating custom checkboxes, radio buttons, switches, and listboxes.
            Example Code: <div role="checkbox" aria-checked="true" tabindex="0">Checkbox</div>

        aria-disabled attribute: This state is used to indicate that an element is disabled only to people using assistive technologies, such as screen readers.
            Example Code: <div role="button" tabindex="-1" aria-disabled="true">Edit</div>

        aria-selected attribute: This state is used to indicate that an element is selected. You can use this state on custom controls like a tabbed interface, a listbox, or a grid.

                                <button role="tab" aria-selected="true">Tab 1</button>
                                <button role="tab" aria-selected="false">Tab 2</button>
                                <button role="tab" aria-selected="false">Tab 3</button>
                            </div>

        aria-controls attribute: Used to associate an element with another element that it controls. This helps people using assistive technologies understand the relationship between the elements.
            Example Code:   <div role="tablist">
                                <button role="tab" id="tab1" aria-controls="section1" aria-selected="true">
                                    Tab 1
                                </button>
                                <button role="tab" id="tab2" aria-controls="section2" aria-selected="false">
                                    Tab 2
                                </button>
                                <button role="tab" id="tab3" aria-controls="section3" aria-selected="false">
                                    Tab 3
                                </button>
                            </div>

        aria-describedby attribute: Used to provide additional information about an element by associating it with another element that contains the information. This gives people using screen readers immediate access to the additional information when they navigate to the element. Common usage would include associating formatting instructions to a text input or an error message to an input after an invalid form submission.
            Example Code:   <form>
                                <label for="password">Password:</label>
                                <input type="password" id="password" aria-describedby="password-help" />
                                <p id="password-help">Your password must be at least 8 characters long.</p>
                            </form>
