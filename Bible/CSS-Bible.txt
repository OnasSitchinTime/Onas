BASIC CSS - REVIEW GUIDE
    CSS Basics
        What is CSS?: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a markup language used to apply styles to HTML elements. CSS is used for colors, background images, layouts and more.

        Basic Anatomy of a CSS Rule:
            Basic Syntax: A CSS rule is made up of two main parts: a selector and a declaration block.A selector is a pattern used in CSS to identify and target specific HTML elements for styling.A declaration block applies a set of styles for a given selector or selectors.
                selector {
                    property: value;
                }

        meta name="viewport" Element: This meta element gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling on different devices, particularly on mobile phones and tablets.

        Default Browser Styles: Each HTML element will have default browser styles applied to them. This usually includes items like default margins and paddings.

    Inline, Internal, and External CSS
        Inline CSS: These styles are written directly within an HTML element using the style attribute. Most of the time you will not be using inline CSS due to separation of concerns.
            Basic Syntax: <p style="color: red;"> This is a red paragraph. </p>

        Internal CSS: These styles are written within the <style> tags inside the <head> section of an HTML document. This can be useful for creating short code examples, but usually you will not need to be using internal CSS.

        External CSS: These styles are written in a separate CSS file and linked to the HTML document using the <link> element in the <head> section. For most projects, you will use an external CSS file over internal or inline CSS.

    Working with the Width: and Height: Properties
        Width Property: This property specifies the width of an element. If you do not specify a width, then the default is set to "auto." This means the element will take up the full width of its parent container.

        Min-width Property: This property specifies the minimum width for an element.

        Max-width Property: This property specifies the maximum width for an element.

        Height Property: This property specifies the height of an element. Similarly, the height is "auto" by default, which means it will adjust to the content inside.

        Min-height Property: This property specifies the minimum height for an element.

        Max-height Property: This property specifies the maximum height for an element.

    Different Types of CSS Combinators
        Descendant Combinator: This combinator is used to target elements that are descendants of a specified parent element. 
            Example Code: 
            *html being stylized*
            <ul>
                <li>EB12</li>
                <li>EB13</li>
                <li>EB14</li>
            </ul>
            *CSS syntax*
            ul li {
                background-color: yellow
            }

        Child Combinator: This combinator is used to select elements that are direct children of a specified parent element.
            Basic Syntax: >
            Example Code:
            *html being stylized*
            <div class="container">
                <p> This will get styled. </p>
                
                <div>
                    <p> This will not get styled. </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            *CSS Syntax*
            .container > p {
                background-color: black;
                color: white;
            }

        Next-sibling Combinator: This combinator selects an element that immediately follows a specified sibling element. 
            Basic Syntax: + 
            Example Code: 
            *html being stylized*
            <h2>I am a subheading</h2>
            <p>This paragraph element will get a red background.</p>
            *CSS Syntax*
            h2 + p {
                background-color: red;
            }

        Subsequent-sibling Combinator: This combinator selects all siblings of a specified element that come after it.
            Basic Syntax: ~
            Example Code:
            *html being stylized*
            <div class="container">
                <p>This will not get styled.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>YS003</li>
                    <li>YS005</li>
                    <li>YS006</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This will get styled.</p>
            </div>
            <p>this will not get styled.</p>
            *CSS Syntax*
            ul ~ p {
                background-color: green;
            }

    Inline, Block, and Inline-Block Level elements
        Inline Level Elements: Inline elements only take up as much width as they need and do not start on a new line. These elements flow within the content, allowing text and other inline elements to appear alongside them.
            Examples Include: span, anchor, and image elements

        Block Level Elements: Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width available to them by default, stretching across the width of their container. 
            Examples Include: div, paragraph, and section elements

        Inline-Block Level Elements: You can set an element to "inline-block" by using the display: property. This causes elements to behave like inline elements but can have a width: and height: set like block-level elements.

    Margin and Padding 
        Margin Property: This property is used to apply space outside the element, between the element's border and the surrounding elements.

        Padding Property: This property is used to apply space inside the element, between the content and its border.

        Margin Shorthand: You can specify 1–4 values to set the margin sides. One value applies to all four sides; two values set top/bottom, then right/left; three values set top, right/left, then bottom; four values set top, right, bottom, left - in that order.

        Padding Shorthand: You can specify 1–4 values to set the margin sides. One value applies to all four sides; two values set top/bottom, then right/left; three values set top, right/left, then bottom; four values set top, right, bottom, left - in that order.

    CSS Specificity
        Inline CSS Specificity: Inline CSS has the highest specificity because it is applied directly to the element. It overrides any internal or external CSS.
            Specificity Value: (1, 0, 0, 0)

        Internal CSS Specificity: Internal CSS is defined within a style element in the head section of the HTML document. It has lower specificity than inline styles but can override external styles.
        External CSS Specificity: External CSS is linked via a link element in the head section and is written in separate .css files. It has the lowest specificity but provides the best maintainability for larger projects.

        Universal Selector: a special type of CSS selector that matches any element in the document. It is often used to apply a style to all elements on the page, which can be useful for resetting or normalizing styles across different browsers. The universal selector has the lowest specificity value of any selector.
            Basic Syntax: * {}
            Specificty Value: (0,0,0,0)

        Type Selectors: These selectors target elements based on their tag name. Type selectors have a relatively low specificity compared to other selectors.
            Specificty Value: (0,0,0,1)

        Class Selectors: These selectors target elements based on their tag name. Class slectors are very commonly used as they have a relatively high specificity level, while still having multiple options for higher specificity elements to over write sections coders wish to style differently.
            Basic Syntax: .Class {}

        ID Selectors: These selectors target elements based on their tag name. Class slectors are very commonly used as they have a very high specificity level. and will only be overwritten by internal or inline CSS.
            Basic Syntax: #id {}
        
        !important Keyword: used to give a style rule the highest priority, allowing it to override any other declarations for a property. When used, it forces the browser to apply the specified style, regardless of the specificty of other selectors. You should be cautious when using this keyword - as it can make yours CSS harder to maintain and debug. 
        
        Cascade Algorithm: An algorithm used to decide which CSS rules to apply when there are multiple styles targeting the same element. It ensures that the most appropriate styles are used, based on a set of well-defined rules.
        
        CSS Inheritance: The process by which styles are passed down from parent elements to their children. Inheritance allows you to define styles at a higher level in the document tree and have them apply to multiple elements without explicitly specifying them for each element.

LISTS, LINKS, BACKGROUND AND BORDERS CSS - REVIEW GUIDE
    Syling Lists 
        Line-height Property: This property is used to create space between lines of text. 
            Accepted Values: normal, numbers, percentages, length units (ex. em)

        List-style-type Property: This property is used to specify the marker for a list item. 
            Acceptable Values: circle, disc, decimal

        List-style-positions Property: This property is used to set the position for the list marker.
            Acceptable Values: inside OR outside

        List-style-image Property: This property is used to use an image for the list item marker. A common use case is to use the url function with a value set to a valid image location.

    Space List Items Using Margin
        Apart from line-height, margins can also be used in CSS to enhance the spacing and readability of list items.

        Margins can create space outside each <li> element, allowing control over the gap between list items.

        Margin-bottom - is used to create space below each list item. 
        Example: margin-bottom: 10px; will create a 10-pixel gap below each list item.

    Styling Links
        pseudo-class: This is a keyword added to a selector that allows you to select elements based on a particular state.

        :link pseudo-class: This pseudo-class is used to style links that have not be visited by the user.

        :visited pseudo-class: This pseudo-class is used to style links where a user has already visited.

        :hover pseudo-class: This pseudo-class is used to style an elements where a user is actively hovering over them.

        :focus pseudo-class: This pseudo-class is used to style an element when it receives focus. 
            Examples Include: input, select

        :active pseudo-class: This pseudo-class is used to style an element that was activated by the user. A common example would be when the user clicks on a button.

    Working with Backgrounds and Borders
        background-size Property: This property is used to set the background size for an element.
            Examples Include: cover, contain

        background-repeat Property: This property is used to determine how background images should be repeated along the horizontal and vertical axes. 
            The default value for background-repeat is repeat meaning the image will repeat both horizontally and vertically. 
            You can also specify that there should be no repeat by using the no-repeat property.

        background-position Property: This property is used to specify the position of the background image. 
        It can be set to a specific length, percentage, or keyword values like top, bottom, left, right, and center.

        background-attachment Property: This property is used to specify whether the background image should scroll with the content or remain fixed in place. 
        The main values are scroll (default), where the background image scrolls with the content, and fixed, where the background image stays in the same position on the screen.

        background-image Property: This property is used to set the background image of an element. 
        You can set multiple background images at the same time and use either the url, radial-gradient or linear-gradient functions as values.

        background Property: This is the shorthand property for setting all background properties in one declaration. 
        Here is an example of setting the background image and setting it to not repeat: background: no-repeat url("example-url-goes-here");

        Good Contract for Background and Foreground Colors:
        It is important to ensure that the background and foreground colors have good contrast to make the text readable. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) recommend a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.
        
    Borders 
        border-top Property: This property is used to set the styles for the top border of an element. 
        border-top: 3px solid blue; sets a 3-pixel-wide solid blue border on the top side of the element.

        border-right Property: This property is used to set the styles for the right border of an element. 
        border-right: 2px solid red; sets a 2-pixel-wide solid red border on the right side of the element.

        border-bottom Property: This property is used to set the styles for the bottom border of an element. 
        border-bottom: 1px dashed green; sets a 1-pixel-wide dashed green border on the bottom side of the element.

        border-left Property: This property is used to set the styles for the left border of an element. border-left: 
        4px dotted orange; sets a 4-pixel-wide dotted orange border on the left side of the element.

        border Property: This is the shorthand property for setting the width, style, and color of an element's border. 
        border: 1px solid black; sets a 1-pixel-wide solid black border.

        border-radius Property: This property is used to create rounded corners for an element's border.

        border-style Property: This property is used to set the style of an element's border. 
        Accepted Values: solid, dashed, dotted, and double.

    Gradients
        linear-gradient () Function: This CSS function is used to create a transition between multiple colors along a straight line.

        radial-gradient () Function: This CSS function creates an image that radiates from a particular point, like a circle or an ellipse, and gradually transitions between multiple colors.

CSS DESIGN FUNDAMENTALS - REVIEW GUIDE
    Design Terminology:
        Layout: This is how visual elements are arranged on a page or screen to communicate a message. These elements may include text, images, and white space.

        Alignment: This is how the elements are placed in relation to one another. Using alignment correctly is helpful for making the design look clean and organized.

        Composition: This is the act of arranging elements to create a harmonious design. It determines how elements like images, text, and shapes relate to each other and contribute to the design in an artistic way.

        Balance: This is how visual weight is distributed within a composition. Designers aim to create an equilibrium through symmetrical or asymmetrical arrangements.

        Scale: This refers to comparing the dimensions or size of one element to that of another.

        Hierarchy: This establishes the order of importance of the elements in a design. It's about making sure that the most important information is noticed first.

        Contrast: This is the process of creating clear distinctions between the elements. You can do this through variations in color, size, shape, texture, or any other visual characteristic. Strong contrast is also helpful for improving readability.

        White Space(negative space): This is the empty space in a design. It's the area surrounding the elements.

        UI(User Interface): UI includes the visual and interactive elements that users can see on their screens, like icons, images, text, menus, links, and buttons.

        UX(User Experience): UX is about how users feel when using a product or service. An application with a well-design user experience is intuitive, easy to use, efficient, accessible, and enjoyable.

        Design Brief: This is a document that outlines the objectives, goals, and requirements of a project. It is a roadmap that guides the design process and ensures that the final product meets the needs of the client.

        Vector Based Design: This involves creating digital art using mathematical formulas to define lines, shapes, and colors.

        Prototyping: This refers to the process of creating an interactive model of a product or user interface.
    
    UI Design Fundamentals
        Good Contrast for Background and Foreground Colors: It is important to ensure that the background and foreground colors have good contrast to make the text readable. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) recommend a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.

        Good Visual Hierarchy in Design: A strong visual hierarchy can provide a clear path for the eye to follow, ensuring that the information you convey is consumed in the order that you intend.

        Responsive Images: Responsive images are images that scale to fit the size of the screen they are being viewed on. This is important because it ensures that your images look good on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

        Progressive Enhancement: This is a design approach that ensures all users, regardless of browser or device, can access the essential content and functionality of an application.

        User-centered Design: This is an approach that prioritizes the end user, from their needs to their preferences and limitations. The goal of user-centered design is to craft a web page that is intuitive, efficient to use, and pleasing for your users to interact with.

        User Research: This is the systematic study of the people who use your product. The goal is to measure user needs, behaviors, and pain points.

        Exit Interviews: This is a survey you can give to users when they cancel their accounts. It can help you understand why users are leaving and what you can do to reduce churn.

        User Testing: This refers to the practice of capturing data from users as they interface with your application.

        A/B Testing: This is the process of shipping a new feature to a randomly selected subset of your user base. You can then leverage analytics data to determine if the feature is beneficial.

        User Requirements: This refers to the stories or rubric that your application needs to follow. User requirements might be defined by user research or industry standards. They can even be defined by stakeholder input.

        Progressive Disclosure: This is a design pattern used to only show users relevant content based on their current activity and hide the rest. This is done to reduce cognitive load and make the user experience more intuitive.

        Deferred/Lazy Registration: This is a UI design pattern that allows users to browse and interact with your application without having to register.
    
    Design Best Practices
        Dark Mode: This is a special feature on web applications where you can change the default light color scheme to a dark color scheme. You should use desaturated colors in dark mode. Desaturated colors are colors that are less intense and have a lower saturation level.

        Breadcrumbs: This is a navigation aid that shows the user where they are in the site's hierarchy. It is best to place breadcrumbs at the top of the page so users can easily find it. Also, you want to make sure the breadcrumbs are large enough to be easily read, but not so large that they take up too much space on the page.

        Card Component: Your card component should be simple in design, not visually cluttered or display too much information. For media, make sure to choose high-quality images and videos to enhance the user experience.

        Infinite Scroll: This is a design pattern that loads more content as the user scrolls down the page. You should consider using a load more button because it gives a user control over when they want to see more content. You can also add a back button so users have the ability to go back to the previous page without having to scroll all the way back up.

        Modal Dialog: This is a type of pop-up that will display on top of existing page content. Usually the background content will have a dim color overlay in order to help the user better focus on the modal content. Also, it is always a good idea to allow the user to click outside of the modal to close it. When you use the HTML dialog element, you will get a lot of the functionality and accessibility benefits built in.

        Progress Indication for Form Registration: This is a way to show users how far they are in a process. It can be used in forms, registration, and setup processes. Your design should be simple, easy to find, and make it possible to go back to previous steps.

        Shopping Cart: Carts are a place for user to see what item they have already selected on an e-commerce platform. Your carts should always be visible to the user, use a common icon like a cart, bag or basket, and have a clear call-to-action button for users to proceed to checkout.

    Common Design Tools
        Figma: This cloud-based tool specializes in User Interface and User Experience (UI / UX) design. It enables design and development teams to collaborate from anywhere, offering built-in features including Vector-based design, automatic layout, a commenting and feedback system and more.

        Sketch: This is a popular design tool used for its intuitive interface and simplicity, making it ideal for developers who want to quickly create prototypes. It's also widely used by designers for tasks like creating UIs, icons, and web layouts.

CSS RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE UNITS - REVIEW GUIDE
    Absolute Units
        Pixels: This absolute unit is a fixed-size unit of measurement in CSS. It is the most common absolute unit and provides precise control over dimensions. 1px is always equal to 1/96th of an inch.
            Basic Syntax: {
                ~~~: ##px;
            }
        
        Inch: This absolute unit is equal to 96px.
            Basic Syntax: {
                ~~~: ##in;
            }
        
        Centimeters: This absolute unit is equal to 25.2/64 of an inch.
            Basic Syntax: {
                ~~~: ##cm;
            }
        
        Millimeters: This absolute unit is equal to 1/10th of a centimeter.
            Basic Syntax: {
                ~~~: ##mm;
            }
    
        Quarter-Millimeters: This absolute unit is equal to 1/40th of a centimeter.
            Basic Syntax: {
                ~~~: ##q;
            }
    
        Picas: This absolute unit is equal to 1/6th of an inch.
            Basic Syntax: {
                ~~~: ##pc;
            }
    
        Points: This absolute unit is equal to 1/72th of an inch.
            Basic Syntax: {
                ~~~: ##pt;
            }

    Relative Units
        Percentages: These relative units allow you to define sizes, dimensions, and other properties as a proportion of their parent element. 
            Think. - if you set {
                width: 50%;
                } on an element, it will occupy half the width of its parent container.

        em Unit: These units are relative to the font size of the element. If you are using ems for the font-size property, the size of the text will be relative to the font size of the parent element.
        
        rem Unit: These units are relative to the font size of the root element, which is the html element.
        
        vh Unit: vh stands for "viewport height" and 1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport's height.
        
        vw Unit: vw stands for "viewport width" and 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport's width.


    Calc Function
        Calc Function: Allows you to perform calculations directly within your stylesheets to determine property values dynamically. This means that you can create flexible and responsive user interfaces by calculating dimensions based on the viewport size or other elements.
            Basic Syntax - Addition:
            *Note, both values must have a unit {
                ~~: calc(##in + ##cm):
            }
            Basic Syntax - Subtraction:
            *Note, both values must have a unit - they do not need to correspond {
                ~~: calc(##px + ##%):
            }
            Basic Syntax - Multiplication:
            *Note, only one value should have a unit - but it could be eaither varible {
                ~~: calc(##vh * ##):
            }
            OR {
                ~~: calc(## * ##rem):
            }
            Basic Syntax - Division:
            *Note, Only the LEFT value should have a unit {
                ~~: calc(##px / ##):
            }

CSS PESUDO-CLASSES - REVIEW GUIDE
    User Action Pseudo-classes
        Pseudo-classes Defintion: These are special CSS keywords that allow you to select an element based on its specific state or position.

        User Action Pseudo-classes: These are special keywords that allow you to change the appearance of elements based on user interactions, improving the overall user experience.
            Common User Action Pseudo-classes - 
                :active Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class lets you select the active state of an element, such as changing the styling you click on a button on link.

                :hover Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class lets you define the hove state of an element.

                :focus Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class applies styles when an element gains focus, typically through keyboard navigation or when a user clicks into a form input.

                :focus-within Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class is used to apply styles to an element when it or any of its descendants have focus.

    Input Pseudo-classes 
        Input Pseudo-classes: These pseudo-classes are used to target HTML input elements based on the state they are in before and after user interaction.
            :enabled Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class is used to target form buttons or other elements that are currently enabled.

            :disabled Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class lets you style an interactive element in disabled mode.

            :checked Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class is used to indicate to the user that it is checked.

            :valid Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class targets the input fields that meet the validation criteria.

            :invalid Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class targets the input fields that do not meet the validation criteria.

            :in-range/:out-of-range Pseudo-classes: These pseudo-classes apply styles to elements based on whether their values are within or outside specified range constraints.

            :required Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class targets input elements that have the required attribute. It signals to the user that they must fill out the field to submit the form.

            :optional Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class applies styles input elements that are not required and can be left empty.

            :autofill Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class applies styles to input fields that the browser automatically fills with saved data.

    Location Pseudo-classes
        Location Pseudo-classes: Pseudo-classes: These pseudo-classes are used for styling links and elements that are targeted within the current document.

        :any-link Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class is a combination of the :link and :visited pseudo-classes. So, it matches any anchor element with an href attribute, regardless of whether it's visited or not.

        :link Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class allows you to target all unvisited links on a webpage. You can use it to style links differently before the user clicks on them.

        :local-link Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class targets links that point to the same document. It can be useful when you want to differentiate internal links from external ones.

        :visited Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class targets a link the user has visited.

        :target Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class is used to apply styles to an element that is the target of a URL fragment.

        :target-within Pseudo-class:  This pseudo-class applies styles to an element when it or one of its descendants is the target of a URL fragment.

    Tree-structural Pseudo-classes
        Tree-structural Pseudo-classes: These pseudo-classes allow you to target and style elements based on their position within the document tree.

        :root Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class is usually the root html element. It helps you target the highest level in the document so you can apply a common style to the entire document. 

        :empty Pseudo-class: Empty elements, that is, elements with no children other than white space, are also included in the document tree. That's why there's an :empty pseudo-class to target empty elements.

        :nth-child(n) Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class allows you to select elements based on their position within a parent.

        nth-last-child(n) Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class enables you to select elements by counting from the end.

        :last-of-type Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class selects the last occurrence of a specific element type within its parent.

        :nth-of-type(n) Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class allows you to select a specific element within its parent based on its position among siblings of the same type.

        :only-of-type Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class selects an element if it's the only one of its type within its parent.

    Functional Pseudo-classes 
        Functional Pseudo-classes: Functional pseudo-classes allow you to select elements based on more complex conditions or relationships. Unlike regular pseudo-classes which target elements based on a state, functional pseudo-classes accept arguments.
            :is() Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class takes a list of selectors (ex. ol, ul) and selects an element that matches one of the selectors in the list.
                Code Example:
                *HTML Stynax*
                <p class="example"> This text will change color.</p>
                <p>This text will not change color.</p>
                <p>This text will not change color.</p>
                <p class="this-works-too">This text will change color.</p>
                *CSS Syntax*
                p:is(.example, .this-works-too) {
                    color: red;
                }

            :where() Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class takes a list of selectors (ex. ol, ul) and selects an element that matches one of the selectors in the list. The difference between :is and :where is that the latter will have a specificity of 0.
                Code Example:
                header:where(h1, h2, h3) {
                    margin: 0;
                    padding: 0;
                }

            :has() Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class is often dubbed the "parent" selector because it allows you to style elements that contain child elements specified in the selector list
                Code Example:
                article:has(h2) {
                    border: 2px solid hotpink;
                }

            :not() Pseudo-class: This pseudo-class is used to select elements that do not match the provided selector.
                Code Example:
                p:not(.example) {
                    color:blue;
                }

    Pseudo-elements
        Pseudo-elements: Behave in a similar way to pseudo-classes, and you can write them into your code simillarily as well. However, they act as if you had added a whole new HTML element into the markup, rather than applying a class to existing elements.
            ::before Pseudo-element: This pseudo-element uses the content property to insert cosmetic content like icons just before the element.

            ::after Pseudo-element: This pseudo-element uses the content property to insert cosmetic content like icons just after the element.

            ::first-letter Pseudo-element: This pseudo-element targets the first letter of an element's content, allowing you to style it.

            ::marker Pseudo-element: This pseudo-element lets you select the marker (bullet or numbering) of list items for styling.

CSS COLORS - REVIEW GUIDE
    Color Theory
        Color Theory Definition: This is the study of how colors interact with each other and how they affect our perception. It covers color relationships, color harmony, and the psychological impact of color.

        Primary Colors: These colors which are yellow, blue, and red, are the fundamental hues from which all other colors are derived.

        Secondary Colors: These colors result from mixing equal amounts of two primary colors. Green, orange, and purple are examples of secondary colors.

        Tertiary Colors: These colors result from combining a primary color with a neighboring secondary color. Yellow-Green, Blue-Green, and Blue-Violet are examples of tertiary colors.

        Warm Colors: These colors which include reds, oranges, and yellows, evoke feelings of comfort, warmth, and coziness.

        Cool Colors: These colors which include blues, green, and purples, evoke feelings of calmness, serenity, and professionalism.
        
        Color Wheel: The color wheel is a circular diagram that shows how colors relate to each other. It's an essential tool for designers because it helps them to select color combinations.

        Analogous Color Schemes: These color schemes create cohesive and soothing experiences. They have analogous colors, which are adjacent to each other in the color wheel.

        Complementary Color Schemes: These color schemes create high contrast and visual impact. Their colors are located on the opposite ends of the color wheel, relative to each other.

        Triadic Color Scheme: This color scheme has vibrant colors. They are made from colors that are approximately equidistant from each other. If they are connected, they form an equilateral triangle on the color wheel.

        Monochromatic Color Scheme: For this color scheme, all the colors are derived from the same base color by adjusting its lightness, darkness, and saturation. This evokes a feeling of unity and harmony while still creating contrast.

    Different Ways to Work with Colors in CSS
        Named Colors: These colors are predefined color names recognized by browsers. 
            Examples Include: blue, darkred, lightgreen, tomato, etc,..

        rgb() Function: RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue — the primary colors of light. These three colors are combined in different intensities to create a wide range of colors. The rgb function allows you to define colors using the RGB color model.
            Basic Syntax: *this code creates a pure red color for the text w/in the paragraph element*
            p {
                color: rgb(255, 0, 0)
            }
        
        rgba() Function: This function adds a fourth value, alpha, that controls the transparency of the color. If not provided, the alpha value defaults to 1.
            Basic Syntax: *this code will create a semi-transparent blue background for the div element.
            div {
                background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5);
            }

        hsl() Function: HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Lightness — three key components that define a color.
            Basic Syntax: *the % iis required after the second and third argurment (the saturation and the light)
            p {
                color: hsl(120, 100%, 50%)
            } 

        hsla() Function: This function adds a fourth value, alpha, that controls the opacity of the color.
            Basic Syntax: 
            div {
                background-color: hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5);
            }

        Hexadecimal: A hex code (short for hexadecimal code) is a six-character string used to represent colors in the RGB color model. The "hex" refers to the base-16 numbering system, which uses digits 0 to 9 and letters A to F.
            Code Examples:
            h1 {
                color: #FF5733; /* A reddish-orange color */
            }

            p {
                    background-color: #4CAF50; /* A shade of green */
            }
    
    Linear and Radial Gradients
        Linear Gradients: hese gradients create a gradual blend between colors along a straight line. You can control the direction of this line using keywords like to top, to right, to bottom right, or angles like 45deg. You can use any valid CSS color and as many color stops as you would like.
            Basic Syntax:
            .linear-gradient {
            background: linear-gradient(45deg, red, #33FF11, rgba(100, 100, 255, 0.5));
            height: 40vh;
            ß}

        Radial Gradients: These gradients create circular or elliptical gradients that radiate from a central point.
            Basic Syntax:
            .radial-gradient {
            background: radial-gradient(circle, red, blue);
            height: 40vh;
            }
